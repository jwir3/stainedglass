StainedGlass
========================

A notification management application for Android.

Introduction
------------------------
The idea for this app started out as an idea to control the LED colors and
settings for individual applications on the Nexus 5. As the project has developed
in my mind, however, it's become a tool for general notification management. The
idea is that some notifications (I use the term "notification" in a more general
sense than the Android notifications, but it definitely encompasses them, as well)
are more important than others (e.g. an emergency call from one's spouse vs. a
Facebook status update from someone you haven't seen for a year), or more urgent
than others (e.g. a friend notifies you he/she wants to grab drinks at a local
restaurant five minutes from now vs. you've been requested to speak at a local
luncheon two months from now).

The purpose of the app is to utilize general learning techniques to filter
various requests made by your phone to you, and propogate the annoyance (and
thus the liklihood you will respond) of the notification upwards based on these
two factors.

Status of the Project
------------------------
Currently, the application is in a pretty rough state. The general concept has
been laid out (I did that above), but how this will be realized is still very
much in flux. Don't expect a working prototype for several months. :)

Development
------------------------
So, you have read this far, and you're still interested, eh? Well, I suppose the
next question is how you can help the project get toward its goal. The simplest
answer is by contributions. This doesn't necessarily mean code. StainedGlass
needs a number of things, including (in no particular order):
- A custom launch icon
- Various artwork for the screens, including:
  - Icons for menus and operations
  - Progress indicators and usability concepts
  - Mock-ups, or "wireframes" for different screens
- Code development (of course)
- Testing and Issue Filing
- Authoring of developer documentation and technical write-ups
- Localization/Internationalization (as time goes on)
